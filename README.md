# PriceSearcher Assessment App

## Introduction:
At Pricesearcher we have a database of 1.1bn products with more than 90bn prices associated
with them. The website is how we communicate that data to the world and build a great
consumer experience. This is a chance for you to show us how you think we should display our
products.

* You can access a limited mock API hosted on
https://pricesearcher-frontend-test.herokuapp.com/
* The API is built using https://github.com/typicode/json-server
* And the object name is products; https://pricesearcher-frontend-test.herokuapp.com/products
* You’ll need to authenticate using an API, using a header named: X-API-KEY
* The API key is 46c0a1e171c76bb37784d60aad4df750

## Exercise

### Requirements:
* Create a website that implements two pages: a search page and a product detail page.
* Create testing for the frontend parts of your implementation.
* Provide instructions on how to build, test and run the website, including all dependencies.
* Device agnostic / Responsive design.


### You might also want to include:
* A mix of server and client-side rendering.
* Visualising the price movements of a product.
* A quick view or hover view for products.
* Pagination/infinite scroll.
* Filters and sorts (e.g. lowest price first, retailer, brand etc).

### Other:
* Don’t worry about header/footer or overall navigation.
* Aesthetics and Render performance are all very important.
